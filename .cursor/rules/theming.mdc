## Component Styles/Theming
- Use inline tailwind classes to style. NEVER use @apply. If you need to use a tailwind color in the style section you can do so with a css custom property like this: var(--color-primary)
- Backgrounds colored with brand or status theme colors should use the proper class as defined in theme.css (for example: .bg-primary)
- All components with brand or theme backgrounds should also support a gradient prop (in which case the corresponding `-bg-gradient` class should be used to style the background)
- Text color classes should always be used based on the background colors of the element the text exists in (for example, .primary-bg should ALWAYS have `primary-content`)
- Only brand and status colors have dedicated classes in @theme.css (like primary-content), for all others the generated tailwind classes based on the theme variables should be used
- When setting backgrounds with theme and status colors do NOT alter their opacity.
- For elements with a brand or status theme background color add a border-1 around it with the main color at 50% opacity like `bg-primary/50`
- container queries are built into Tailwind v4
