# Component Rules

- All components should exist in the `/components` directory
- They should be documented in the `/content/components` directory and mirror the file structure from the components directory
- Each component should exist in it's own folder and be prefixed by it's folder name. The folder can also include sublementary components that are only meant for use within the slot of the main component. And example of this structure is as follows:

```
- components
    - Modal
        - Modal.vue
        - ModalBody.vue
        - ModalHead.vue
        - ModalActions.vue
```

- No need to import vue functions like ref, they are auto-imported
- If using a prop named class, make sure to alway reference it as `props.class` and NEVER just `class` in the template.
- Each component should also include a histoire story in the same directory as it's defined

## Component Styles
- Use inline tailwind classes to style. NEVER use @apply. If you need to use a tailwind color in the style section you can do so with a css custom property like this: var(--color-primary)
- Brand theme colors and status colors all have a main color and a gradient mix color. Elements that have brand or status colored backgrounds should always include a solid and a gradient version where the main color and gradient mix colors form a gradient
