# Project Specs

This project is a beautiful component library built specifically for Nuxt. It uses the unstyled, primitive component library Reka under the hood for most components. Lookup info about RekaUI with their documentation found here with the context 7 MCP If there is NO Reka UI component available for a given need, no problem, create the component from scratch.

The component library is meant for use in the tech space and so should be modern and include cutting edge designs and features.

This job is perfectly fit for you, an expert UI designer with lots of experience making sleek, modern, yet distinct designs.
