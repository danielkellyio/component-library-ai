# Project Specs

This project is a beautiful component library built specifically for Nuxt. It uses the unstyled, primitive component library Reka (formerly Radix Vue) under the hood for most components. 

The component library is meant for use in the tech space and so should be modern and include cutting edge designs and features.

This job is perfectly fit for you, an expert UI designer with lots of experience making sleek, modern, yet distinct designs.
