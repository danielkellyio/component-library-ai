# Button Component Implementation

Implement a new button component according to the project design system and component rules.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create task list
- [x] Sample existing components for inspiration
- [x] Implement the Button component definition (`components/Button/Button.vue`)
- [x] Write a Histoire story for the Button component (`components/Button/Button.story.vue`)
- [x] Write documentation for the Button component (`content/components/Button.md`)

## In Progress Tasks

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add advanced features (e.g., loading states, icon integration) if not covered initially.

## Implementation Plan

The button component will be a versatile UI element used throughout the application. It will adhere to the established design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and radius. It should support different visual variants (e.g., primary, secondary, outline) and sizes.

### Relevant Files

- `content/components/Button.md` - Documentation file for the button component. ✅
- `assets/theme.css` - Will be referenced for design tokens.
- `types/props.ts` - Will be checked for existing common props and potentially updated if new reusable props are identified.
