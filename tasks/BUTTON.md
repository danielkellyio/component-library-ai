# Button Component Implementation

Implement a new button component according to the project specifications and design system.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create task list for button component
- [x] Sample existing components for design inspiration and review design tokens
- [x] Implement the Button.vue component definition
- [x] Create Button.story.vue for Histoire
- [x] Write documentation for the button component

## In Progress Tasks

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add advanced button features (e.g., loading states, icon integration) if not covered in initial implementation

## Implementation Plan

The button component will be a core UI element. It will be built using Reka UI primitives if applicable, styled with inline Tailwind CSS classes, and adhere to the dark-mode-first theme. It will support different variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost) and sizes (sm, md, lg).
